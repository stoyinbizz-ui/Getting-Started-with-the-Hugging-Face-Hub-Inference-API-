        "Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting effective prompts or instructions for language models in order to steer them towards a desired behaviour. Language models like Llama, generate text based on the provided instructions. Prompt engineering involves carefully designing and formulating prompts to elicit desired responses from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Principles for crafting effective prompts**\n",
        "Generally, there are no absolute rules for crafting the ‘perfect’ prompt because numerous factors must be considered, such as the type of model being used, the application’s objectives, and the supporting infrastructure. However, there are established principles that consistently yield beneficial results when integrated into the prompt. Let’s explore a few of these principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Principle 1:** Be very specific and clear about the instruction and task you want the model to perform. Assign system roles describing intended behaviour when necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Principle 2:** Break complex tasks into subtasks, this approach provides the necessary setup to allow the model adequate time for processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Principle 3:** Avoid saying what not to do but say what to do instead. This encourages more specificity and focuses on the details that lead to good responses from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Principle 4:** Use delimiters within your prompt. A delimiter can be any sequence of charac- ters or symbols that is clearly marks distinct sections within a prompt, separating instructions, examples, and desired output. For example, we can consider the following sequences to be delimiters:\n",
        "\n",
        "      • >>>>\n",
        "      • ====\n",
        "      • ------\n",
        "      • ####\n",
        "\n",
        "**Don't confuse writing a clear prompt with writing a short prompt because in many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity and context for the model, which leads to more detailed and relevant outputs.**"

Considering potential edge cases and defining how the model should handle them is also important to avoid unexpected errors or outcomes.

Think of this as breaking down a complicated task into bite-sized, logical chunks. To construct a chain-of-thought prompt, a user typically appends an instruction such as \"**Describe your reasoning in steps**\" or \"**Explain your answer step by step**\" to the end of their query to a large language model (LLM). In essence, this prompting technique asks the LLM to not only generate an end result, but also detail the series of intermediate steps that led to that answer.\n",

So, **Aunt Agatha did not kill herself**.)\n> \n> 2. **The only people who live in Dreadbury Mansion are Aunt Agatha, the butler, and Charles.**  \n> → Only three people: Agatha, Butler, Charles.\n> \n> 3. **A killer always hates his victims, and is never richer than his victims.**  \n> → Two key points:\n>    - A killer **hates** the victim.\n>    - A killer is **not richer** than the victim → so the killer is **less rich or equal** in wealth (but \"never richer\", so not richer than victim).\n> \n> 4. **Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates.**  \n> → If Aunt Agatha hates X, then Charles does **not** hate X.  \n> (So Charles’s set of people he hates is a subset of the people Agatha **does not** hate.)\n> \n> 5. **Aunt Agatha hates everyone except the butler.**  \n> → Agatha hates **everyone except the butler**.  \n> Since the only residents are Agatha, Butler, Charles, the people she *does not* hate are: the butler.  \n> So Agatha hates: Charles and the butler? Wait — \"hates everyone except the butler\".\n> \n> Let’s clarify:\n> \n> - \"Hates everyone except the butler\" → she hates **everyone** **except** the butler.  \n> → So Agatha hates: Charles and the person who is not the butler.  \n> → Agatha hates Charles and the butler? No — she hates **everyone except the butler**. So **she does not hate the butler**, but hates everyone else.\n> \n> So in the group {Agatha, Butler, Charles}:\n> - Agatha hates Charles.\n> - Agatha hates **no one** else — **except** Butler? Wait: “hates everyone except the butler” means she **does not hate** the butler, and hates the others.\n> \n> Therefore:\n> - Agatha **hates Charles**.\n> - Agatha **does not hate** the butler.\n> \n> So: **Agatha hates Charles, does not hate Butler.**\n> \n> 6. **The butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha.**  \n> → The butler hates every person **who is not richer than Agatha**.  \n> That is: he hates people with wealth ≤ Agatha’s wealth.\n> \n> \"Never richer than\" means: wealth ≤ Agatha.\n> \n> So if X is not richer than Agatha → wealth(X) ≤ wealth(Agatha) → butler hates X.\n> \n> So: Butler hates all people who are **less rich or equally rich** than Agatha.\n> \n> 7. **The butler hates everyone Aunt Agatha hates.**  \n> → Butler hates **everyone** that Agatha hates.\n> \n> Agatha hates Charles (from premise 5).  \n> She does **not** hate the butler.  \n> So Butler hates Charles (from premise 7).\n> \n> 8. **No one hates everyone.**  \n> → Nobody has hatred toward all three people.  \n> So for any person, there is at least one person they do **not** hate.\n> \n> 9. **Aunt Agatha is not the butler.**  \n> → Confirmed: Agatha ≠ Butler → so Agatha and Butler are distinct people.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Now, let's proceed with step-by-step deductions.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 1: Who could have killed Agatha?\n> \n> The killer is one of the three:\n> - Agatha (impossible — she was killed)\n> - Butler\n> - Charles\n> \n> So possible killers: **Butler or Charles**\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 2: Analyze Agatha’s hatreds (premise 5)\n> \n> Agatha hates: **Charles**  \n> Agatha does **not** hate: **Butler**\n> \n> So:\n> - Agatha hates Charles ✅\n> - Agatha does not hate Butler ✅\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 3: Premise 4: Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates.\n> \n> Agatha hates Charles → so Charles does **not** hate Charles?\n> \n> Wait, let's parse carefully:\n> \n> \"Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates.\"\n> \n> → So if Agatha hates X, then Charles does **not** hate X.\n> \n> Agatha hates **Charles** → so Charles must **not** hate Charles.\n> \n> Therefore: Charles does **not** hate Charles.\n> \n> But note: the phrase \"hates no one that Agatha hates\" — so Charles does **not** hate anyone that Agatha hates.\n> \n> So the only person Agatha hates is Charles → so Charles does **not** hate Charles.\n> \n> → So Charles does **not** hate himself.\n> \n> Now, Charles may hate others — but only people Agatha **does not** hate.\n> \n> Agatha does **not** hate the butler.\n> \n> So Charles **can** hate the butler — because it's someone Agatha doesn't hate.\n> \n> But Charles **cannot** hate Charles.\n> \n> So Charles’s hates:\n> - Does **not** hate Charles\n> - May hate Butler (since Agatha doesn't hate Butler)\n> \n> → So possible: Charles hates Butler or not → unknown.\n> \n> But we know: Charles hates **no one** Agatha hates → Agatha hates only Charles → so Charles cannot hate Charles → confirmed.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 4: Premise 7: Butler hates everyone that Agatha hates.\n> \n> Agatha hates Charles → Butler hates Charles.\n> \n> So Butler hates Charles.\n> \n> So Butler hates Charles.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 5: Premise 6: Butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha.\n> \n> That is:\n> → If a person is **not richer** than Agatha (i.e., wealth ≤ Agatha), then Butler hates them.\n> \n> So Butler hates:\n> - All people who are **≤** Agatha in wealth.\n> \n> Now, Agatha herself is obviously not richer than herself → so Agatha is not richer than Agatha → therefore, Butler **must hate Agatha**.\n> \n> But wait — the premise says: \"the butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha\".\n> \n> So:\n> - Anyone with wealth ≤ Agatha → Butler hates them.\n> \n> → Agatha has wealth = Agatha → she is not richer than herself → so Butler hates Agatha.\n> \n> But Agatha is the victim — and the butler hates the victim? That might be relevant.\n> \n> Now, recall **premise 3**:\n> \n> > A killer always hates his victim, and is never richer than his victim.\n> \n> So if the butler killed Agatha:\n> - He must hate Agatha (✅ from above)\n> - He must not be richer than Agatha (i.e., wealth ≤ Agatha)\n> \n> So both conditions are needed.\n> \n> Let’s suppose **Butler is the killer**.\n> \n> → Then:\n> - Butler must hate Agatha → from premise 6 (since Agatha is not richer than herself) → yes, he hates her ✅\n> - Butler must not be richer than Agatha → so he is ≤ Agatha in wealth → ✅\n> \n> So that seems possible?\n> \n> Wait — but premise 3 also says: \"A killer is never richer than his victim\" → so killer is not richer → so wealth(killer) ≤ wealth(victim)\n> \n> So yes, for Butler to be the killer, he must have wealth ≤ Agatha.\n> \n> Now, is this compatible with other premises?\n> \n> But let’s also consider **premise 8**: **No one hates everyone.**\n> \n> That is: nobody hates all three residents — Agatha, Butler, Charles.\n> \n> So, Butler must **not** hate all three.\n> \n> Let’s figure out who Butler hates.\n> \n> From premise 6: Butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha → so:\n> - Agatha: not richer than herself → Butler hates her ✅\n> - Charles: depends on Charles’s wealth\n> - Butler: self?\n> \n> Does Butler hate himself?\n> \n> We don’t have a premise about self-hatred.\n> \n> But premise 8 says: \"no one hates everyone\" → so Butler does **not** hate all three people.\n> \n> Therefore, Butler must **not** hate at least one of Agatha, Butler, or Charles.\n> \n> But we already know:\n> - Butler hates Agatha (because Agatha is not richer than her)\n> \n> So:\n> - He hates Agatha ✅\n> → Therefore, to **not** hate everyone, he must **not** hate either Charles or himself.\n> \n> But from premise 7: Butler hates everyone that Agatha hates → Agatha hates Charles → so Butler hates Charles ✅\n> \n> So Butler hates Charles ✅\n> \n> So Butler hates:\n> - Agatha ✅\n> - Charles ✅\n> \n> What about Butler himself?\n> \n> If Butler hates himself → then he hates Agatha, Charles, and himself → hates all three → which violates premise 8: **No one hates everyone.**\n> \n> Therefore, Butler cannot hate himself.\n> \n> So Butler **does not hate himself**.\n> \n> So his hate list:\n> - Hates Agatha ✅\n> - Hates Charles ✅\n> - Does **not** hate himself ❌\n> \n> So Butler hates two people (Agatha and Charles), and not himself → so does **not** hate everyone → satisfies premise 8 ✅\n> \n> So **Butler could be the killer**, provided:\n> - He is not richer than Agatha → so wealth ≤ Agatha → ✅ (required by premise 3)\n> \n> But is that the only constraint?\n> \n> Let’s now consider **Charles as the killer**.\n> \n> Could Charles have killed Agatha?\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 6: Can Charles be the killer?\n> \n> For Charles to be the killer:\n> - He must hate Agatha (premise 3: killer hates victim) → ✅?\n> - He must not be richer than Agatha → wealth(Charles) ≤ wealth(Agatha)\n> \n> So both must be true.\n> \n> Now, from premise 5: Agatha hates Charles → so by premise 4: Charles hates **no one that Agatha hates**.\n> \n> → Agatha hates Charles → so Charles **does not** hate Charles.\n> \n> But Charles must hate Agatha (as a killer) → is that possible?\n> \n> Wait — can Charles hate Agatha?\n> \n> Agatha hates Charles → so Charles hates **no one that Agatha hates** → so Charles cannot hate Charles → but could he hate Agatha?\n> \n> Agatha hates Charles → that is, Agatha hates Charles.\n> \n> So Charles must **not** hate Charles.\n> \n> But the statement is: \"Charles hates no one that Agatha hates\" → not about hating Agatha, but about hating people in Agatha’s hate list.\n> \n> So, the only person Agatha hates is Charles.\n> \n> So Charles must not hate **Charles**.\n> \n> But Charles **can** hate **Agatha** — Agatha is not in Agatha’s hate list.\n> \n> Yes — Agatha hates Charles, not herself or the butler.\n> \n> So Agatha does **not** hate the butler or herself.\n> \n> Therefore, the only person Agatha hates is Charles → so Charles **must not hate Charles** → but he can hate others — including Agatha.\n> \n> So **Charles can hate Agatha**.\n> \n> Therefore, condition 3:\n> - Charles hates Agatha ✅\n> - Charles is not richer than Agatha → wealth(Charles) ≤ wealth(Agatha) ✅\n> \n> So both required conditions are **possible**, in theory.\n> \n> But wait — **premise 4** says: Charles hates no one that Agatha hates.\n> \n> Agatha hates only Charles → so Charles must not hate Charles.\n> \n> He can hate others → so can he hate Agatha?\n> \n> → Agatha is not a person that Agatha hates → Agatha does **not** hate Agatha.\n> \n> So Agatha's hate set = {Charles}\n> \n> Therefore, Charles does **not** have to avoid hating Agatha.\n> \n> So yes — Charles can hate Agatha → so he can be the killer.\n> \n> So both Butler and Charles seem to satisfy the hatred requirement.\n> \n> But we need to determine **which one** is the killer.\n> \n> So now the key is to look for contradictions.\n> \n> Let’s go back to **premise 6** and **premise 7** to get more details.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Step 7: Butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha\n> \n> So:\n> - Butler hates all people with wealth ≤ Agatha\n> \n> Agatha herself: wealth = Agatha → so Butler hates Agatha ✅\n> Charles: if Charles is not richer than Agatha → Charles ≤ Agatha → Butler hates Charles ✅\n> Butler himself: wealth = ? → if Butler ≤ Agatha → Butler hates himself → **but then Butler hates everyone** → violates premise 8.\n> \n> So if Butler hates himself, and hates Agatha and Charles, then he hates all three → violates premise 8.\n> \n> But premise 8: **No one hates everyone** → so Butler **cannot** hate himself.\n> \n> Therefore, **Butler does not hate himself** → so he is **richer** than Agatha → wealth(Butler) > wealth(Agatha)\n> \n> (If Butler were ≤ Agatha, then from premise 6, he would hate everyone not richer than Agatha → including himself → contradiction)\n> \n> Therefore:\n> \n> > Butler is **richer** than Agatha → wealth(Butler) > wealth(Agatha)\n> \n> But now, premise 3 says: **A killer is never richer than his victim**\n> \n> So a killer must **not** be richer than the victim.\n> \n> If Butler were the killer, he must have wealth ≤ Agatha → but we just deduced wealth(Butler) > Agatha → contradiction.\n> \n> Therefore, **Butler cannot be the killer**.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## Conclusion: Butler is ruled out.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Now, only possibility left: **Charles killed Agatha**\n> \n> Let’s verify that Charles satisfies all conditions.\n> \n> ### Check if Charles can be the killer:\n> \n> 1. **Charles hates Agatha**?  \n> → Yes, as required by premise 3: killer hates victim.  \n> We already said Charles can hate Agatha because Agatha does not hate Agatha — Agatha only hates Charles → so Charles can hate Agatha without violating premise 4.\n> \n> Premise 4: Charles hates no one that Agatha hates → so Charles must not hate Charles → but does not prevent him from hating Agatha.\n> \n> So ✅ Charles hates Agatha.\n> \n> 2. **Charles is not richer than Agatha** → wealth(Charles) ≤ wealth(Agatha)\n> \n> → Required by premise 3 → so we must have Charles ≤ Agatha → ✅\n> \n> Now, is this compatible with other premises?\n> \n> Let’s check if any contradiction arises.\n> \n> We also have premise 6: butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha.\n> \n> We already used that to deduce that Butler is richer than Agatha → so Butler > Agatha.\n> \n> So Charles is ≤ Agatha → so Charles is not richer than Agatha → so Butler, by premise 6, must hate Charles.\n> \n> But we already knew from premise 7 that Butler hates Charles → since Agatha hates Charles → so Butler hates Charles → ✅\n> \n> Premise 7: Butler hates everyone that Agatha hates → Agatha hates Charles → Butler hates Charles → ✅\n> \n> Premise 4: Charles hates no one that Agatha hates → Agatha hates only Charles → so Charles does not hate Charles → ✅\n> \n> Premise 8: no one hates everyone → so Charles must not hate all three.\n> \n> Charles hates Agatha (as killer), and does **not** hate Charles → so he does not hate himself.\n> \n> Who else does Charles hate?\n> \n> We don't know — but he cannot hate all three.\n> \n> Could he hate Butler?\n> \n> Possibly — but only if that's allowed.\n> \n> But let's see: does Charles hate anyone else?\n> \n> Agatha hates only Charles → so Charles must not hate Charles.\n> \n> Can Charles hate Butler?\n> \n> → Butler is not in Agatha’s hate list → Agatha does not hate Butler → so Charles **can** hate Butler → no restriction.\n> \n> So if Charles hates Butler, that would be okay.\n> \n> But does that matter?\n> \n> Premise 8: Charles must **not** hate everyone.\n> \n> So if Charles hates Agatha and possibly Butler, but **not** Charles → he does not hate himself → so even if he hates Butler, he doesn’t hate Charles → so does not hate everyone.\n> \n> So as long as Charles does **not** hate himself, he avoids hating everyone.\n> \n> So Charles hates:\n> - Agatha ✅\n> - Possibly Butler\n> - Does **not** hate Charles ❌\n> \n> So Charles does not hate everyone → satisfies premise 8 ✅\n> \n> Is there any restriction on who Charles hates?\n> \n> Only premise 4: avoids hating people Agatha hates → i.e., Charles → so Charles must not hate Charles → already satisfied.\n> \n> So Charles can hate Agatha and possibly Butler — but does not hate himself.\n> \n> So his hates: Agatha and possibly Butler → so never all three → satisfies premise 8.\n> \n> Now, is there any contradiction with the wealth?\n> \n> We have:\n> -

Someone who lives in Dreadbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha → Charles lives there → ✅  \n> 2. Only residents: Agatha, Butler, Charles → ✅  \n> 3. Killer hates victim and is not richer than victim → Charles hates Agatha and is not richer → ✅  \n> 4. Charles hates no one that Agatha hates → Agatha hates only Charles → Charles does not hate Charles → ✅  \n> 5. Agatha hates everyone except the butler → hates Charles, not Butler → ✅  \n> 6. Butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha → Butler is richer than Agatha → so Butler does **not** hate himself → hates people with wealth ≤ Agatha → Agatha (yes) and Charles (if Charles ≤ Agatha) → Charles is ≤ Agatha → so Butler hates Charles → ✅  \n>    (Note: Butler does **not** hate himself → so not hated all → satisfies premise 8)  \n> 7. Butler hates everyone that Agatha hates → Agatha hates Charles → Butler hates Charles → ✅  \n> 8. No one hates everyone →  \n>    - Butler hates Agatha and Charles, but not himself → does not hate all → ✅  \n>    - Charles hates Agatha and possibly Butler, but not himself → does not hate all → ✅  \n>    - Agatha: who? Agatha does not hate Butler (premise 5) and hates Charles → so Agatha hates Charles, does not hate Butler or herself?  \n>      → Self-hatred? Not specified. But even if she hates Charles and not Butler, she might not hate herself. But anyway — the condition is only about hate towards others. But premise 8 is \"no one hates everyone\" — so we need to check the full set.\n> \n> Agatha hates:\n> - Charles ✅\n> - Does not hate Butler ✅\n> - Does not hate herself? → unclear.\n> \n> But premise 8 says \"no one hates everyone\" — so for Agatha to hate everyone, she must hate Butler, Charles, and Agatha herself.\n> \n> But she hates Charles → does she hate Butler? No → she hates **everyone except the butler** → so she does **not** hate Butler.\n> \n> So Agatha does **not** hate Butler → so definitely does not hate everyone → ✅\n> \n> So no one hates all three → ✅\n> \n> 9. Agatha is not the butler → ✅\n> \n> All premises are satisfied.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ## ✅ Final Answer:\n> \n> **Charles killed Aunt Agatha.**\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ### Summary of Reasoning:\n> \n> - The only possible candidates are Butler or Charles (Agatha was killed).\n> - Butler cannot be the killer because:\n>   - From premise 6: Butler hates everyone not richer than Agatha.\n>   - From premise 8: No one hates everyone → so Butler does **not** hate himself.\n>   - Therefore, Butler is **richer** than Agatha.\n>   - But premise 3 says a killer is **never richer** than the victim → contradiction.\n> - Charles can be the killer because:\n>   - He hates Agatha (allowed by premise 4 — Agatha does not hate Agatha).\n>   - He is not richer than Agatha (required by premise 3).\n>   - He does not hate himself (so does not hate everyone) → satisfies premise 8.\n> - All other premises are consistent with Charles being the killer.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> ✅ **Conclusion: Charles is the murderer.**"

The butler, who hates everyone else, could not hate himself without contradicting premise 8; therefore, he must be wealthier than Aunt Agatha to avoid self-hatred, per premise 6.
