 Getting Started with the HuggingFace API

This repository provides a simple, beginner-friendly introduction to using the **HuggingFace Inference API**.  
It includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through how to authenticate, send requests, and work with popular HuggingFace models for tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, embeddings, and more.


 📘 Contents

- **Getting_Started_with_the_HuggingFace_API.ipynb**  
  A step-by-step notebook demonstrating:
  - Setting up API access
  - Making requests to HuggingFace models
  - Handling responses
  - Example use cases (text generation, classification, embeddings, etc.)

 🚀 Getting Started

 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
